# Academic-Progression-Predictor-using-Python
This project predicts student progression outcomes based on credit scores at the pass, defer, and fail levels, following specific university criteria. The program prompts for these credits, validates input, calculates outcomes, and provides detailed results across multiple student entries. It also includes:

- Multi-Student Processing: Allows predicting outcomes for multiple students in one run.
- Validation Mechanisms: Ensures data integrity with checks for data type, credit range, and total credits.
- Histogram Visualization: Displays a visual summary of outcomes, using the graphics.py library.
- Data Storage: Stores outcomes in a list and optionally saves to a text file for persistence.

Key Features:
1. User-friendly input validation.
2. Supports multiple students with an easy quit option.
3. Histograms to visually represent the distribution of progression outcomes.
   
This project is ideal for university administrators or staff to efficiently process and predict studentsâ€™ progression statuses in a structured and visual format.
